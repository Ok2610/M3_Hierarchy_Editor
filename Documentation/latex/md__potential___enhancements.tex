\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Display the hierarchy on a panel and allow moving the panel ~\newline
 {\itshape (The goal is to modify the tags in the hierarchy while having the Vi\+RMA display). → Work in progress} ~\newline

\item Zoom {\itshape (Use the joysticks\+: one to move the hierarchy, the other to zoom in/out).} ~\newline

\item Delete Branch {\itshape (Delete a node and all its child nodes below).} ~\newline

\item When deleting, allow reattaching the children to the grandparent {\itshape (P+2 parent).} ~\newline

\item Search for a node by its name within a hierarchy. ~\newline

\item Implement security in the API to prevent creating loops in hierarchies ~\newline
 {\itshape (e.\+g., root → child1 → child1\+\_\+1 → root → …).} ~\newline
  ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Inter-\/hierarchy movement {\itshape (Drag and drop a node from a hierarchy into another one).}
\item Optimize display refresh during modifications {\itshape (Refresh only the visual of the node modified instead of every nodes).}
\item Rollback function {\itshape (Async between Unity and the DB with a commit button).}
\item Shorten wide nodes {\itshape (In case we choose to work on wide hierarchies).}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add parent {\itshape (Evolution of “\+Add node”\+: If the name given in “\+Add node” already exists, then the node with that name becomes the parent of the current node. If the name is unknown, a child node is created for the current node).}
